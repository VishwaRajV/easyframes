The Nemesis Project is designed to be a command line based, portable human 
IP stack for UNIX-like and Windows systems.  The suite is broken down by 
protocol, and should allow for useful scripting of injected packets from 
simple shell scripts.

Key Features:

+ ARP/RARP, DNS, ETHERNET, ICMP, IGMP, IP, OSPF*, RIP, TCP and UDP protocol 
  support
+ Layer 2 or Layer 3 injection (by presence/absence of -d <dev> switch)
  on UNIX-like systems
+ Layer 2 injection on Windows systems (regardless of whether 
  -d <device number> is used
+ Packet payload from file
+ IP and TCP options from file
+ Tested on OpenBSD, Linux, Solaris, Mac OS X and Windows 2000

Each supported protocol uses its own protocol "injector" which is accompanied
by a man page explaining its functionality.

*OSPF is currently non-functional

Consult the ChangeLog for current release details.  Consult the documentation
for each protocol injector for in-depth descriptions of the available 
functionality.

Thanks to everyone that has reported bugs and especially those that have
provided patches.
